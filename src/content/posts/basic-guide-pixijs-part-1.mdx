import {BasicShape, AnimatedShape} from "../../anim/SquareShapeMove.tsx"

# Getting Started 
In this guide, I'll show you how to get started with PixiJS. This guide will cover creating graphics and making them move. We'll also explore collision detection between graphics objects.

# Graphics
First, we need to initialize a Square object and implement its movement. But before that, let's create the graphics.

> [!note] In PixiJS, Graphics not a Drawing tool. But as a Geometry building tool.

```js
// Create a Graphics object, draw a rectangle and fill it
let obj = new Graphics()
  .rect(0, 0, 100, 100)
  .fill("#FFA09E")
//  position, center of the screen
obj.x = app.screen.width / 2.5;
// Add it to the stage to render
app.stage.addChild(obj);
```

<p/>

`rect()` is a function to create a Rectangle, and `fill()` is a function to fill the Rectangle with a color. Then we need to add it to the stage to render.

Result:

<BasicShape client:load/>

# Animate
Now let's make it move! Animation in PixiJS uses Ticker callbacks. A Ticker is a function that will be called every frame.

```js
app.ticker.add(() => {
    // Infinite loop
})

```
When you log something inside the ticker callback, you'll get a log entry for every frame. Let's implement this with our current graphics object:

```js
let obj = new Graphics()
  .rect(0, 0, 100, 100)
  .fill("#FFA09E")

app.ticker.add(() => {
    obj.x += 1
})
```
Result:

> [!warning] Since this animation runs in an infinite loop, be careful of memory leaks. We need to optimize memory usage after this.

<AnimatedShape client:load/>

# Memory Management
We need to release memory when we no longer need to render objects that have moved off-screen. Let's add conditions to check if the shape has moved out of the screen boundaries.
There are two methods I typically use:

## Graphics.destroy()
This is useful when you don't need the graphics object anymore. In games, you can think of this as something like a bullet or projectile.

```js
if (obj.x >= app.screen.width || obj.y >= app.screen.height || obj.x < 0 || obj.y < 0) {
 obj.destroy()
}

```

## App.ticker.stop()
This approach is useful when you need to refresh the animation, such as when you want to restart the animation like the example on this page.

```js
if (obj.x >= app.screen.width || obj.y >= app.screen.height || obj.x < 0 || obj.y < 0) {
 app.ticker.stop()
}

const handleRefresh = () => {
    // Get the current graphics in the stage and set the beginning position  
    app.stage.children[0].position.set(0,0)
    // Start from the beginning 
    app.ticker.start()
}
```

# To be continue ...
