1. reset the data changes to `un-stashed` changes
2. re-commit the file 
3. push to split branch

Reset the data changes to un-stashed changes.

1. You need to `checkout` to specific branch first; for example; `huge-branch` 
2. Run this command
```sh
git reset --soft master
```
3. Do commit as usual and push to different branch

**Or complete script**
```sh
git checkout migrate-to-firebase
git reset --soft develop
git restore --staged .
```
